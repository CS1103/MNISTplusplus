# Features

MNIST++ offers the following key features:

## 1. Handwritten Digit Recognition

MNIST++ allows you to input images of handwritten digits and uses a trained neural network to accurately recognize and classify them. The system leverages the Backpropagation algorithm and the MNIST dataset to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition tasks.

## 2. Customizable Neural Network Architecture

With MNIST++, you have the flexibility to design and customize the architecture of the neural network. You can experiment with different configurations, including the number of layers, activation functions, and network size, to optimize the performance of the digit recognition system.

## 3. Training and Evaluation

MNIST++ provides functionality for training the neural network using the MNIST dataset. You can train the network on a subset of the dataset and evaluate its performance on unseen data. This allows you to measure the accuracy and effectiveness of the model in recognizing handwritten digits.

## 4. Performance Optimization

The system incorporates gradient descent optimization to improve the performance of the neural network. You can experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the digit recognition process.

## 5. Command-Line Interface

MNIST++ offers a user-friendly command-line interface for interacting with the application. You can easily input images, initiate the digit recognition process, and obtain the results directly from the command prompt.

## 6. Extensive Documentation

To support users, MNIST++ includes comprehensive documentation that covers various aspects of the project. The documentation provides instructions, diagrams, installation guides, and additional information to facilitate understanding and usage of the application.

Explore these features and leverage the capabilities of MNIST++ for accurate handwritten digit recognition and neural network experimentation.
